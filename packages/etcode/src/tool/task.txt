Launch a new agent to handle complex, multistep tasks autonomously.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
{agents}

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Task tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly

Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The output includes a task_id you can reuse later to continue the same subagent session.
3. Each agent invocation starts with a fresh context unless you provide task_id to resume the same subagent session.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research, since it is not aware of the user's intent.
