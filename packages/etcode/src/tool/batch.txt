Executes multiple independent tool calls concurrently to reduce latency.

Payload Format (JSON array):
[{"tool": "read", "parameters": {"filePath": "src/index.ts", "limit": 350}},{"tool": "grep", "parameters": {"pattern": "Session", "include": "src/**/*.ts"}}]

Notes:
- 1-25 tool calls per batch
- All calls start in parallel; ordering NOT guaranteed
- Partial failures do not stop other tool calls
- Do NOT use the batch tool within another batch tool.

Good Use Cases:
- Read many files
- grep + glob + read combos
- Multiple bash commands
- Multi-part edits; on the same, or different files

When NOT to Use:
- Operations that depend on prior tool output (e.g. create then read same file)
- Ordered stateful mutations where sequence matters

Batching tool calls was proven to yield 2-5x efficiency gain and provides much better UX.
